An updated version of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1851854787]Societal Advancement[/url]. Fixed known issues and compatible with new versions. [b]Compatible with 3.2.*.[/b]

[h2]Features[/h2]

Add a observation outpost mission that will advance the primitive society to the next stage of civilization.

You need to research a societal tech called "Society Uplifting", which requires that you meets a primitive civilization, to do this.

[b]Don't activate this mod and the original one at the same time.[/b]

Not achievement compatible.

I personally recomomend [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1695559328]Species Engineering[/url] if you want to create primitive civiliaztions or pre-sapient species.
